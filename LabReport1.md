# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
due Monday, April 10 by 10pm

### 1. Finding the CSE15L Course Account
Using the website https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php
- search for course username by putting in your username and student ID (beginning with A or U)

Then click the Additional Account beginning with cs15lsp23 to where the screen will change to:

and then click the Global Password Change Tool to change the password

### 2. Verify that VSCode is Installed
Use this website https://code.visualstudio.com/ if not installed
The interface should appear as:

  I already had the application installed so I skipped this step

### 3. Remotely Connect Using Your Course Account
If using a Windows computer, ensure that Git for Windows is installed, if not use the link https://gitforwindows.org/ to install. Mac computers can skip this step.

Then following steps from the link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994
- Open the terminal ```(Ctrl + Shift + ` )```
- Open the command palette ```(Ctrl + Shift + P)```
- Type "Select Default Profile"
- Select "Git Bash" from the options

- Click the + icon in the terminal window, the new terminal will now load to a Git Bash terminal

Next remotely connect with the course account we found in step 1:
- ```ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu ```
     - don't include the $, convention for command in terminal
     - replace the zz with your account
- If you see a message asking to verify yes/no if you want to connecting, say yes it's the first time, but if it's a system you often frequent, it could be someone else trying to control your access 
     - type "yes" and enter
- Then your screen should look similar to this:
