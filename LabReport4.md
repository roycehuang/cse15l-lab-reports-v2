keys pressed: ```ssh cs15lsp23mf@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>``` 
in order to ssh into the account
I didn't have to enter a password because I followed the steps from the Week 7 lab to use an SSH key for my ieng6 account.

### Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

keys pressed: ```git clone git@github.com:roycehuang/lab7.git <enter>```
in order to clone the fork of the lab7 repository

### Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

keys pressed: ```bash test.sh <enter>```
in order to run the tests

### Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test

keys pressed: ```vim ListExamples.java <enter>``` in order to make edits to the file to fix the failing test ```/index1 += <enter> <n> <n> <rightarrow> <rightarrow> <rightarrow> <rightarrow> <rightarrow> <rightarrow> <i> <backspace> <2> <escape> :wq!``` edited the file and made the change, then saved and quit vim editor. 

by using ```/index1 += ``` the ```/``` command under the normal mode searches for the string following it. In this case it searched for instances of "index1 += ", and by pressing the key ```<n>``` vim goes to the next instance of the string. Then, using right arrows to get to the location of where to edit, we enter the insert mode using ```<i>``` and delete once to delete the 1 after index and replace it with 2. Then click ```<escape>``` to return to the normal mode and press ```:wq!``` in order to save and quit vim editor.

### Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

keys pressed: ```<up><up><enter>``` The ```bash test.sh``` command was 2 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow to access it and run it again now that changes were made to ListExamples.java

### Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

keys pressed: ```git add ListExamples.java <enter> git commit -m "edited ListExamples.java" <enter> git push origin main <enter>```
by using these commands I was able to add, commit, and push the changes to the fork I have on github.
